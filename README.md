## Project Description

The Teacher-Student Discussion Board and Assignment Program is a web application developed using Django, Python, HTML, and CSS. Its primary purpose is to facilitate communication between teachers and students by providing a platform for posting assignments, discussing topics, sharing information, and more. The application is designed to be scalable, accommodating multiple classes and discussions simultaneously.

For phase 2 I completely redesigned my project. It now has 4 apps to do different things instead of just 1 app. Makes it alot cleaner and easier to work with.
